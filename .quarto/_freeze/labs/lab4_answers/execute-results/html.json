You will practice with checking the different assumptions, and practice with accounting for some of the assumptions with additional steps. Please note that these assumptions can only be checked once you have selected a (final) model, as these assumptions 'need' a model that they apply to.\n\nWe will use the following packages in this practical:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(ggplot2) \nlibrary(regclass)\nlibrary(MASS) \n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n# Data set: Loading & Inspection\n\nFor the first part of this practical, a data set from a fish market is used. You can find the dataset in the surfdrive folder. The variables in this fish data set are:\n\n* Species of the fish\n* Weight of the fish in grams\n* Vertical, length of the fish in cm\n* Diagonal length of the fish in cm\n* Cross length of the fish in cm\n* Height of the fish in cm\n* Diagonal width of the fish in cm </li>\n\nDownload the dataset from the Surfdrive folder, store it in the folder of your `Rproject` for this practical and open it in `R`. Also, adjust the column names according to the code below to make them a bit more intuitive. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in the data set\ndata_fish <- read.csv(\"Fish.csv\")\n\ncolnames(data_fish) <- c(\"species\", \"weigth\", \"vertical_length\", \"diagonal_length\", \"cross_length\", \"height\", \"diagonal_width\")\n\n# Check the data set with the 'head' function to have a general impression.\ndata_fish %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  species weigth vertical_length diagonal_length cross_length  height\n1   Bream    242            23.2            25.4         30.0 11.5200\n2   Bream    290            24.0            26.3         31.2 12.4800\n3   Bream    340            23.9            26.5         31.1 12.3778\n4   Bream    363            26.3            29.0         33.5 12.7300\n5   Bream    430            26.5            29.0         34.0 12.4440\n6   Bream    450            26.8            29.7         34.7 13.6024\n  diagonal_width\n1         4.0200\n2         4.3056\n3         4.6961\n4         4.4555\n5         5.1340\n6         4.9274\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n# Model assumptions\n\nWe will now discuss and check the various model assumptions of linear regression. If steps can be taken to account for a violated assumption, this will also be touched upon. \n\n---\n\n## Linearity\n\nWith the assumption of linearity, it is assumed that the relation between the dependent and independent variables is (more or less) linear. You can check this by generating a scatterplot using a predictor variable and outcome variable of the regression model.\n\n1. __Check whether there is a linear relation between the variables vertical length and the cross length.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data_fish, \n       aes(x = vertical_length, y = cross_length)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"linear relation is present\") +\n  xlab(\"vertical length in cm\") +\n  ylab(\"cross length in cm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab4_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. __Next check the relation between weight and height.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data_fish, aes(x = weigth, y = height)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"linear relation is missing\") +\n  xlab(\"Weigth in gram\") +\n  ylab(\"heigth in cm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab4_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3. __Describe both plots. What differences do you see?__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The first plot shows a case where there is a more or less linear relation (Vertical length of the fish and cross length of the fish). In the second plot, the relation is clearly not linear.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen a non-linear relation is present, you can either choose another model to use, or transform the predictor before adding it to the model, for example using a log-transformation. Applying a transformation, however, will not always solve the problem, and makes interpretation of the model less intuitive. \n\n4. __Apply a log-transformation to the weight variable.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_fish$weigth_trans <- data_fish$weigth %>% \n  log()\n```\n:::\n\n\n5. __Plot the relation between length and weight again, but now including the transformed variable.__ \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data_fish, aes(x = weigth_trans, y = height)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"linear relation improved\") +\n  xlab(\"Weigth in gram\") +\n  ylab(\"heigth in cm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab4_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n6. __Describe if the transformation improved the linear relation.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# You see that the relation is still not completely linear, but a lot more linear than before the transformation (plot 2).\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Predictor matrix full rank\n\nThis assumption states that:\n<li>there need to be more observations than predictors (n > P).\n<li>no predictor can be a linear combination of other predictors; predictors cannot have a very high correlation (multicollinearity).</li><br>\n\nThe first part of this assumption is easy to check: see if the number of observations minus the number of predictors is a positive number. The second part can be checked by either obtaining correlations between the predictors, or by determining the VIF (variance inflation factor). When the VIF is above 10, this indicate high multicollinearity. To account for this, predictors can be excluded from the model, or a new variable can be constructed based on predictors with a high correlation. \n\nTo examine VIF scores, the function `VIF()` from the `regclass` can be used on a prespecified model. If this model includes a categorical variable with multiple categories, such as 'species' in the example data, the generalized VIF is used, and we have to look at the third column (GVIF^\\*(1/(2\\*Df))), these values can be compared to normal VIF values. \n\n7. __Specify a linear model with `weight` as outcome variable using all other variables in the dataset as predictors.

Furthermore, The errors must be independent of the predictors. \n\n12. __What is the possible consequence of not meeting this assumption?__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Not meeting this assumption results in biased estimates for the regression coefficients.\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Constant, finite error variance\n\nThis assumptions is also called 'the assumption of homoscedasticity'. It states that the variance of the error terms should be constant over all levels of the predictors. This can be checked by plotting the residuals against the fitted values. These plots can be obtained by simply taking the first plot of a specified model, `plot(model_x)`.\n\n\n13. __Create a residual vs fitted values plot for `model_fish1`, which is the first plot generated by the `plot()` function.__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_fish1 %>%\n  plot(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab4_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n14. __Load in the `iris` data, and specify a model where sepal length is predicted by all other variables and save this as `model_iris1`.__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_iris   <- iris\nmodel_iris1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., \n                  data = data_iris)\n```\n:::\n\n\n15. __Create a residual vs fitted plot for this model as well.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_iris1 %>%\n  plot(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab4_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n16. __Discuss both plots and indicate whether the assumption is met.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# In the `iris_data` plot, it can be seen that the red line is quite constant. Also, the dots seem to have a rather constant variance. In the `fish_data` plot, however, the variance in error terms seems smaller for the lower values than for the higher values. This second plot indicates heteroscedasticity and indicates that the assumption is violated.\n```\n:::\n\n\n17. __Discuss what the consequence would be if this assumption is violated.__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# If this assumption is violated, estimated standard errors are biased.\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Independent errors\n\nThis assumption states that error terms should have no correlation. Dependence of the errors can result from multiple things. First, there is a possible dependence in the error terms when there is serial dependence, for example because the data contains variables that are measured over time. Another reason can be when there is a cluster structure in the data, for example students in classes in schools. \n\n18. __How can both causes of correlated error terms be detected, and what can be done to solve the problem?__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Temporal dependence can be checked by investigating the autocorrelation, while clustered data can be found by investigating the intra class correlation (ICC).\n\n# More important: dealing with these dependencies requires another model (multilevel for clustered data, or a model that account for the time aspect). Those models are out of the scope of this course, but always be aware of a theoretical dependency between your errors.\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Normally distributed errors\n\nThis assumption states that errors should be roughly normally distributed.

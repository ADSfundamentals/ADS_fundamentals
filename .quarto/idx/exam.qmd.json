That being said, a certain degree of \nmathematical literacy is crucial to statistics and data science, so you will \nhave to do some simple calculations on the exam. For example, you should be \ncomfortable with the following.\n\n- Working with the linear regression equation, $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i +\\varepsilon_i$, to:\n   - Calculate predicted values give certain inputs\n   - Interpret parameter estimates\n   - Evaluate hypotheses/research questions\n\n- The differences between:\n   - The full regression model: $Y_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_i +\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i$\n   - The equation for the best-fit line: $\\hat{Y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_i$\n\n- The definition of a residual: \n   - $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i = Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i$\n\n- The relationship between probabilities ($p$) and odds (for binary outcomes):\n   - $\\text{odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$\n\n- The definition of the logit function:\n   - $\\ln(\\text{odds}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\text{logit}(p)$\n\n- The definition of the logistic function, its relation to the logit function, \nand its role in logistic regression:\n   - $\\text{logistic}(\\eta_i) = \\text{logit}^{-1}(p_i) = \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1+\\exp(\\eta_i)} = \\frac{\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_i)} = \\hat{p}_i$\n\nOf course, you should also be able to do basic arithmetic operations that are \ntoo trivial to detail here (e.g., calculating the difference between the $R^2$ \nstatistics from two models that you are trying to compare).\n\n**Note**: Although all examples above are shown in terms of simple linear \nregression models, you should also be able to do these calculations/interpretations \nusing multiple linear regression models and models that include dummy codes and\ninteractions.\n\n## Q&A and practice exam\n\n-   The lecture on Monday January 12 will be completely devoted to a recap of the material and there will be plenty of time to answer all your questions.

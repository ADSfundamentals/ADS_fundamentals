This data set contains the measurement of different iris species (flowers), you can find more information [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/iris).\n\n1.  **Load the dataset and explain what variables are measured in the first three columns of your data set.**\n\n\n\n## Inspecting the dataset\n\nA good way of eyeballing on a relation between two continuous variables is by creating a scatterplot.\n\n2.  **Plot the sepal length and the petal width variables in a `ggplot` scatter plot (`geom_points`)**\n\n\n\nA loess curve can be added to the plot to get a general idea of the relation between the two variables. You can add a loess curve to a ggplot with `stat_smooth(method = \"loess\")`.\n\n3.  **Add a loess curve to the plot under question 2, for further inspection.**\n\n\n\nTo get a clearer idea of the general trend in the data (or of the relation), a regression line can be added to the plot. A regression line can be added in the same way as a loess curve, the method argument in the function needs to be altered to `lm` to do so.\n\n4.  **Change the loess curve of the previous plot to a regression line. Describe the relation that the line indicates.**\n\n\n\n## Simple linear regression\n\nWith the `lm()` function, you can specify a linear regression model. You can save a model in an object and request summary statistics with the `summary()` command. The model is always specified with the code `outcome_variable ~ predictor`.\n\nWhen a model is stored in an object, you can ask for the coefficients with `coefficients()`. The next code block shows how you would specify a model where petal width is predicted by sepal width, and how summary statistics for this model would look like\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify model: outcome = petal width, predictor = sepal width\niris_model1 <- lm(Petal.Width ~ Sepal.Width,\n                  data = iris)\n\nsummary(iris_model1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Petal.Width ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.38424 -0.60889 -0.03208  0.52691  1.64812 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Store this model as \\`model1. Supply summary statistics for this model.**\n\n\n\n6.  **Based on the summary of the model, give a substantive interpretation of the regression coefficient.**\n\n\n\n7.  **Relate the summary statistics and coefficients to the plots you made in questions 2 - 4.**\n\n\n",

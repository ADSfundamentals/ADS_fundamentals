## Required R skills

In this course, you will use both R and RStudio.

If you have never worked with R before, use the tutorials from [Open Statistical Programming](https://www.openstatprog.com/) to be ready and prepared before the course starts. The materials discussed in the tutorials

-   Software setup

-   First steps

-   Data types

-   Basic visualizations

are required knowledge before you start the course!

## Required statistical knowledge

We expect you to be familiar with some basic statistical concepts such as:

-   Descriptive statistics

-   Sampling

-   Correlation

-   T-test

-   P-values

To refresh your memory, you can read [SDAM](https://mspeekenbrink.github.io/sdam-book/index.html) Ch. 1, 2 and 3.

The course material builds on this knowledge, and it can also be part of the exam.

*Note: if you followed the course ADS-BOS, you have covered these topics and you should be good to go!*

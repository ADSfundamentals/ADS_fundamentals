This is easy to check: you just need to be sure that the outcome can only take one of two responses. You can plot the responses of the outcome variable to visually check this if you want. In our case, the possible outcomes are:\n\n* Survived (coded 1)\n* Did not survive (coded 0)\n\n3. __Visualise the responses of the outcome variable `Survived` using `ggplot()`.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Survived, fill = Survived)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Survival\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Distribution of the outcome variable\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab6_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# You can see that there are indeed only two outcomes for `Survived`, so our outcome follows a binomial distribution.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Balanced outcomes\n\nIf you are using logistic regression to make predictions/classifications then the accuracy will be affected by imbalance in the outcome classes. Notice that in the plot you just made there are more people who did not survive than who did survive. A possible consequence is reduced accuracy in classification of survivors. \n\nA certain amount of imbalance is expected and can be handled well by the model in most cases. The effects of this imbalance is context-dependent. Some solutions to serious class imbalance are down-sampling or weighting the outcomes to balance the importance placed on the outcomes by the model. \n\n## Sufficiently large sample size\n\nSample size in logistic regression is a complex issue, but some suggest that it is ideal to have 10 cases per candidate predictor in your model. The minimum number of cases to include is $N = \\frac{10*k} {p}$, where $k$ is the number of predictors and $p$ is the smallest proportion of negative or positive cases in the population. \n\n4. __Calculate the minimum number of positive cases needed in the model `fit1`.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#First we need to get the proportion of people that survived in our sample, which is 0.38*\n\ntitanic %>% \n  count(Survived) %>% \n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Survived     n  prop\n  <fct>    <int> <dbl>\n1 0          549 0.616\n2 1          342 0.384\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Now we can plug this into our formula to get the minimum number of positive cases. \nssize_cal <- function(k, p){\n  round((10*k)/p)\n}\n\nssize_cal(2, 0.38)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 53\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#We have many more than this in our data so the sample size is large enough.*\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Predictor matrix is full-rank\n\nYou learned about this assumption in the linear regression practicals, but to remind you:\n\n* there need to be more observations than predictors (n > P)\n* there should be no multicollinearity among the linear predictors\n\n5. __Check that there is no multicollinearity in the logistic model.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#VIF(fit1)\nVIF(fit2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                GVIF Df GVIF^(1/(2*Df))\nAge         1.236805  1        1.112117\nSex        10.776569  1        3.282769\nPclass     28.991163  2        2.320419\nSex:Pclass 42.044233  2        2.546400\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Like with linear regression we can use the VIF.

For categorical predictors we should check the \"GVIF^(1/(2*Df))\" column.\n\n# In model 1, the VIF cannot be determined since there is only a single predictor.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Continuous predictors are linearly related to the $logit(\\pi)$\n\nLogistic regression models assume a linear relationship between predictor variables and the logit of the outcome variable. This assumption is mainly concerned with continuous predictors. Since we only have one continuous predictor (`Age`) we can plot the relationship between `Age` and the logit of `Survived`. \n\n6. __Get the predicted values of `fit2` on the logit scale and bind them to the `titanic` data.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We do this using the `predict()` function, but specifying `type = \"link\"` this time. \n\ntitanic$logit <- predict(fit2, type = \"link\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n7. __Plot the relationship between `Age` and `logit` and interpret it.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \nggplot(aes(Age, logit))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\") + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab6_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Age does appear to be negatively linearly related to the predicted logit values.\n```\n:::\n\n\n8. __How should we deal with variables that are not linearly related to the logit?__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This differs per situation. One solution can be to try to apply transformations to the variables. \n```\n:::\n\n\n## No influential values or outliers\n\nInfluential values are extreme individual data points that can affect the fit of the logistic regression model. They can be visualised using Cook's distance and the Residuals vs Leverage plot. \n\n9. __Use the `plot()` function to visualise the outliers and influential points of `fit2`.__\n\n**Hint: you need to specify the correct plot with the `which` argument.

The first is Cook's distance plot, which shows the top 3 largest values. Note that not all outliers are influential cases, so we should also inspect the Residuals vs Leverage plot, which shows actual influential cases.\n\n# You can get both of these plots by specifying `which = c(4, 5)` in the `plot()` function.\n\nplot(fit2, which = c(4, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab6_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab6_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n10. __Are there any influential cases in the Leverage vs Residuals plot?

In logistic regression, we do not need:\n\n* constant, finite error variance\n* normally distributed errors\n\nHowever, deviance residuals are useful for determining if the individual points are not fit well by the model. \n\n*Hint: you can use some of the code from the lecture for the next few questions.*\n\n11. __Use the `resid()` function to get the deviance residuals for `fit2`.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndr <- resid(fit2, type = \"deviance\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n12. __Compute the predicted logit values for the model.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neta <- predict(fit2, type = \"link\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n13. __Plot the deviance residuals.__\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The first step is to bind the deviance residuals to the logit values.\n\ndr_data <- data.frame(residuals = dr, \n                      eta = rep(eta, 3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in data.frame(residuals = dr, eta = rep(eta, 3)): row names were found\nfrom a short variable and have been discarded\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Now we can plot the data with the residuals on the y-axis, and the logit values on the x-axis.* \n\nggplot(dr_data, aes(x = eta, y = residuals)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Deviance residuals\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab6_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nPearson residuals can also be useful in logistic regression.

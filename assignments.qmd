Both assignments are group assignments. We will form groups of 4 at the first workgroup meeting, and you work on both assignments with the same group throughout the rest of the course.

In order to be assigned to a group, presence at the first meeting is crucial!

## Assignment 1: Linear regression

-   **Type of assignment:** Written report.

-   **Grading:** 25% of your final grade

-   **Deadline:** Monday December 8, 15:00

-   **What to submit:** A ZIP archive containing the complete R project (dataset, .qmd, HTML)

-   **Where to submit:** [Here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/index.php/s/vDu5h9LNlwE6KhN)

-   **What is graded:** Only your .html file is graded, so make sure all code, comments and output are visible!

-   **Description:** For this assignment, you perform and report a multiple linear regression analysis in an R markdown document. The assignment will be graded on the following five dimensions:

1.  **Preliminaries:** Introduction of your research questions, description and potential processing of your data.

2.  **Model estimation:** Description of the model estimates, model fit, and model comparison procedure.

3.  **Assumptions:** Testing of model assumptions, checking for influential cases. Act upon and/or reflect on violations when needed.

4.  **Interpretation:** Substantive interpretation of the final model. Answering your research question.

5.  **Layout:** Structure of the document, efficiency of output presentation, use of custom functions (when applicable). Presentation of suitable visualizations.

## Assignment 2: Logistic regression

Group assignment 2: Logistic regression

-   **Type of assignment:** Presentation and discussion

-   **Grading:** 25% of your final grade

-   **Presentation:** WG meeting Thursday January 15

-   **Deadline:** Wednesday January 14, 15:00. Hand in your ZIP archive including your slides. Your WG instructor will set the slides up for the presentations on Thursday.

-   **What to submit:** A ZIP archive containing the complete R project (dataset, .qmd, slides)

-   **Where to submit:** [Here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/index.php/s/vDu5h9LNlwE6KhN)

-   **Description:** For this assignment, you perform and report a multiple logistic regression analysis in an R markdown document. The assignment will be graded on the following five dimensions:

1.  **Preliminaries:** Introduction of your research questions, description and potential processing of your data.
2.  **Model estimation:** Description of the model estimates, model fit, and model comparison procedure.
3.  **Assumptions:** Testing of model assumptions, checking for influential cases. Act upon and/or reflect on violations when needed.
4.  **Interpretation:** Substantive interpretation of the final model (including the confusion matrix). Answering your research question.
5.  **Layout:** Structure of the document, efficiency of output presentation, use of custom functions (when applicable). Presentation of suitable visualizations.

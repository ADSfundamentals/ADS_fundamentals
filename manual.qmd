## Course content

Regression techniques are widely used to quantify the relationship between two or more variables. In data science, linear and logistic regression are common and powerful techniques for evaluating such relations. These techniques are only useful, however, once you understand when and how to apply them. In this course, students will learn how to apply linear and logistic regression with the R statistical software package.

This course will introduce students to the principles of analytical data science, linear and logistic regression, and the basics of statistical learning. Students will develop fundamental R programming skills and will gain experience with tidyverse: visualize data with ggplot2 and performing basic data wrangling with dplyr. This course helps prepare students for an entry-level research career (e.g. junior researcher or research assistant) or further education in research (e.g., a \[research\] Master program or a PhD).

## Course structure

In seven weeks, you will learn the basics of data handling and statistical programming with R and details about regression techniques in the context of statistical inference, prediction, and classification. Each week will comprise four activities:

-   During the weekly **in-person lectures**, we will cover the theoretical content.

-   During the weekly **in-person workgroup** meetings, you will work on real-world data analysis with a group of your peers.

-   Weekly **self-study practical exercises** connect the statistical theory to practice by applying the lecture content in the R statistical programming language.

-   There is an **online weekly Q&A** session in case you get stuck or have questions.

## How to pass the course

Your final grade consists of three elements:

| Grade component         | Weight | Required minimum grade |
|-------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Group assignment 1      | 25%    | 5.5                    |
| Group assignment 2      | 25%    | 5.5                    |
| Written exam in Remindo | 50%    | 5.5                    |

### Attendance

During this course, you will attend 7 lectures, 7 workgroup sessions and hand in 6 practical assignments.

**Attendance** for the lectures and the workgroup sessions **is mandatory**. You work on your group assignments during the workgroup meetings. For a collaborative spirit, attendance is crucial.

## Course objectives and learning outcomes

### Course objectives

At the end of this course, students are able to:

1.  Identify key statistical concepts such as:

-   (Conditional) probability

-   Inference

-   Estimation

-   Prediction

-   Classification

-   Sampling variability

-   Statistical modeling

-   Residuals Fitted values

2.  Choose an appropriate regression model for a given research scenario.

3.  Explain the differences/similarities between statistical inference and model-based prediction/classification; give examples of each type of problem.

4.  Identify the assumptions of linear and logistic regression; describe the consequences of violating these assumptions.

5.  Describe the three components of a generalized linear model and how these components are specified in logistic regression.

6.  Interpret the estimates from linear and logistic regression models, and use these estimates to answer research questions.

7.  Use the R statistical software platform to perform basic statistical programming, data manipulation, data visualization, and basic data wrangling.

8.  Use the R statistical software platform to perform, interpret, and evaluate linear and logistic regression analyses on real-world data.

9.  Interpret R output and use the results to answer research questions.

10. Use Quarto to document the results of a statistical analysis.

### Rationale for assessment strategy

In this course, skills and knowledge are evaluated with two types of assignment.

1.  The exam evaluates knowledge and understanding of statistical concepts (Learning goal 1), the ability to critically evaluate research problems and statistical methods (Learning goals 2–5), and the ability to interpret statistical results and software output and apply these interpretations (Learning goals 6 & 9).

2.  The group assignments evaluate the student’s ability to work with data, solve basic data analytic problems, execute quantitative data analyses on real-world data sets, and document the results (learning goals 6–10).

## Important notice about Generative AI in this course

### Definition

Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as images, videos, audio and text. An example is the chatbot ChatGPT. GenAI generates new and unique output based on a prompt from a user by analysing large amounts of existing data.

### Guidelines

Utrecht University has [these guidelines](https://www.uu.nl/en/education/quality-and-innovation/generative-ai) regarding GenAI.

You are always responsible for your own work and are never allowed to submit work developed entirely by GenAI as your own. If this does happen, it is considered fraud. See for more information the relevant parts of the EER. GenAI use includes, but is not limited to, generating text, audio, images, video and code. Regarding code, you may use AI tools to assist you in generating code that results in reproducible data sets. However, you may not generate data sets.

We would like to emphasize that taking this course is an investment in your own development. The material has been carefully put together to deepen your understanding of the field and strengthen your skills. By distributing or even selling this material, you violate the intellectual property of the UU. We therefore ask you to respect these guidelines and contribute to a fair and honest learning environment.

### Scenario for this course

You may use GenAI to prepare the work you hand in. You can use GenAI to gain inspiration for research questions, or help with debugging your R code.

You CANNOT use genAI to generate text or code for the two assignments that you hand in.

You CANNOT generate data sets with GenAI.

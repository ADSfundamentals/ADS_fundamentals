## Today

- Introduction
- Course structure
- Work group structure
- Assignments

*break*

- Start first assignment

## Introduction

- Introduce yourself
- What is your background (study)? 
- Why did you choose this minor/course? 

## Course structure 

- Monday 15:15: Lecture by Dr. K. Lang **on location**
- Tuesday 13:15: Q&A by Dr. K. Lang **online**
- Thursday 09:00 & 11:00: Workgroup meetings **on location**

By yourself: 

- Do the required reading
- Work on practicals (deadline is next Monday 15:00, before the next lecture)
- Continue work on group assignment 

## Workgroup meetings

- Apply the lecture topics to your own (real!) datasets 
- Meet your group to work together 

## Assignments

## Assignments

Grading:

- Both group assignments contribute 25% to your final grade
- All group members receive the same grade 
- If names are omitted from groups/assignments, we assume everyone is aware of this. 

Hand in: 

- Through SurfFileDrop (link is on website)
- Hand in a .zip file with R project and all files (html, qmd, dataset)
- Make sure all code and text are visible in the html files
- Only content in html files is graded!!!! 
- Check the course website for more information

## This week:

- Make groups of max. 4 students 
- Look for a dataset 
- Inspect variables
- Come up with research questions for linear and logistic regression
- Pre-processing of the dataset where needed 

## Dataset requirements 

The dataset should at least contain:

- A continuous outcome variable 
- At least two continuous predictor variables
- A categorical predictor variable 
- A dichotomous outcome variable 

## Tips for datasets 

Look for datasets online: 

- Kaggle
- GitHub
- CBS/Eurostat
- RIVM
- Through scientific papers
- Large panel studies (PISA, LISS, EVS, ESS, TIMSS)
- DANS KNAW or ODISSEI portal

Datasets from courses can be difficult for this purpose, don't use them!  

## Example research questions 

Linear regression: 

- Can body weight predict the level of cholesterol in Dutch adults? 
- What variables are related to income in the Netherlands? 

Logistic regression: 

- Do body weight, calorie intake, fate intake and age have an influence on the occurence of a heart attack? 
- What variables can be used to predict whether students pass a driving test? 

## Data processing 

Examples:

- Are the character classes set correctly? Adjust with functions such as `as_factor()` or `as_numeric()`
- Are missing values correctly recognized? 
- Do you need to calculate any sumscores or meanscores? 
- Do you need to link multiple separate datasets? 

## Use of Generative AI

You are allowed to:

- Gain inspiration
- Ask for help how to tackle an assignment

You are not allowed to: 

- Submit generated text or code as if it was written by you
- Have text or code revised 

## Before the end of the meeting

As a group, send an email to your WG instructor with: 

- Names of group members
- How you agree to collaborate
- Selected data set (topic and link)
- Research questions you want to answer in your assignments 

Send this email before the end of the meeting!
